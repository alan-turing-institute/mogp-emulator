Kernel module, implements a few standard kernels for use with the

kernel and Matern 5/2 kernel, both with either a single correlation
length (``UniformSqExp``, ``UniformMat52``) or correlation lengths

class StationaryKernel(KernelBase):
    r"""
    Generic class representing a stationary kernel

    This base class implements the necessary scaffolding for defining a stationary kernel.
    Stationary kernels are only dependent on a distance measure between any two points, so
    the base class holds all the necessary information for doing the distance computation.
    Individual subclasses will implement the functional dependence of the kernel on the
    distance, plus first and second derivatives (if desired) to compute the gradient or
    Hessian of the kernel with respect to the hyperparameters.

    This implementation uses a scaled euclidean distance metric. Each individual parameter
    has a hyperparameter scale associated with it that is used in the distance computation.
    If a different metric is to be defined, a new base class needs to be defined that
    implements the ``calc_r``, and optionally ``calc_drdtheta`` and ``calc_d2rdtheta2``
    methods if gradient or Hessian computation is desired. The methods ``kernel_f``,
    ``kernel_gradient``, and ``kernel_hessian`` can then be used to compute the appropriate
    quantities with no further modification.

    Note that the Kernel object just collates all of the methods together; the class itself
    does not hold any information on the data point or hyperparamters, which are passed
    directly to the appropriate methods. Thus, no information needs to be provided when
    creating a new ``Kernel`` instance.
