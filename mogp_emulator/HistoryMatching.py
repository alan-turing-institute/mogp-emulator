class HistoryMatching(object):
    r"""
    Class containing tools to implement history matching between the outputs of a
    gaussian process and an observation.

    Primary usage is the ``get_implausibility`` method, which calculates the
    implausibility metric (a number of standard deviations between the emulator mean
    and the observation) for a number of query points:

    .. math::
        {I_i(\bar{x_0}) = \frac{|z_i - E(f_i(\bar{x_0}))|}
        {\sqrt{Var\left[z_i - E(f_i(\bar{x_0}))\right]}}}

    The code allows a number of ways to specify variances, and all are summed to
    compute the final variance that determines the implausibility measure.
    Variances on the observation itself can be provided with the observations,
    while variances arising from the GP prediction are included in the emulator
    expectations. Additional variances can be included to account for model
    discrepancy when computing the implausibility metric, and these can be uniform
    for all query points, or vary across different query points if desired. Any
    number of additional variances can be included in the calculation by passing
    them when computing the implausibility.

    Once implausibility is computed, the class can determine query points that
    can be ruled out, as well as points that are not ruled out yet, based on the
    threshold class attribute. See the methods ``get_RO``, ``get_NROY``, and
    ``set_threshold`` for more details.

        ``.obs``, ``.coords``, ``.expectations``, ``.ndim``, ``.ncoords``,
        ``.threshold``, ``.I``, ``.NROY``, and ``.RO`` variables as placeholders.
        The optional keyword arguments can also be used to set user-defined values for
        various quantities in a single call to ``HistoryMatching()``. Setting sufficient
        numbers of these to allow the number of dimensions and/or number of coordinates to
        be computed also causes these to be set at this stage.

                       points to be considered and ``D`` is the number of parameters
                       for the GP). Only required if ``expectations`` is not provided.
