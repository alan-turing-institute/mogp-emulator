class HistoryMatching(object):
    r"""
    Class containing tools to implement history matching between the outputs of a
    gaussian process and an observation.

    Primary usage is the ``get_implausibility`` method, which calculates the
    implausibility metric (a number of standard deviations between the emulator mean
    and the observation) for a number of query points:

    .. math::
        {I_i(\bar{x_0}) = \frac{|z_i - E(f_i(\bar{x_0}))|}
        {\sqrt{Var\left[z_i - E(f_i(\bar{x_0}))\right]}}}

    The code allows a number of ways to specify variances, and all are summed to
    compute the final variance that determines the implausibility measure.
    Variances on the observation itself can be provided with the observations,
    while variances arising from the GP prediction are included in the emulator
    expectations. Additional variances can be included to account for model
    discrepancy when computing the implausibility metric, and these can be uniform
    for all query points, or vary across different query points if desired. Any
    number of additional variances can be included in the calculation by passing
    them when computing the implausibility.

    Once implausibility is computed, the class can determine query points that
    can be ruled out, as well as points that are not ruled out yet, based on the
    threshold class attribute. See the methods ``get_RO``, ``get_NROY``, and
    ``set_threshold`` for more details.

    Example - implausibility computation for a 1D GP::

            for i in range(n_points):
                f[i] = np.sin(2*math.pi*x[i] / 50)
            return f
        y_training = get_y_training(x_training)

        gp = GaussianProcess(x_training, y_training)
        np.random.seed(47)
        gp.learn_hyperparameters()

          a) The coords and gp parameters are set
          b) The expectations parameter is set

        will be used when making predictions. If the user wishes to have more control

        the user should explicitly pass ``expectations`` to the object.

        discrepancy that describes the prior beliefs regarding how well the model
        matches reality. In practice, the model discrepancy is essential to have
