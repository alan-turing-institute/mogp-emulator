class MultiOutputGP(object):
    """
    Implementation of a multiple-output Gaussian Process Emulator.
    
    This class provides an interface to fit a Gaussian Process Emulator to multiple targets
    using the same input data. The class creates all of the necessary sub-emulators from
    the input data and provides interfaces to the ``learn_hyperparameters`` and ``predict``
    methods of the sub-emulators. Because the emulators are all fit independently, the
    class provides the option to use multiple processes to fit the emulators and make
    predictions in parallel.
    
    The emulators are stored internally in a list. Other useful information stored is the
    numer of emulators ``n_emulators``, number of training examples ``n``, and number of
    input parameters ``D``. These other variables are made available externally through
    the ``get_n_emulators``, ``get_n``, and ``get_D`` methods.
    
    Example: ::
    
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mogp_emulator import MultiOutputGP
        >>> x = np.array([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]])
        >>> y = np.array([[4., 6.], [5., 7.]])
        >>> mogp = MultiOutputGP(x, y)

        Create a new multi-output GP Emulator
        
        Creates a new multi-output GP Emulator from either the input data and targets to
        be fit or a file holding the input/targets and (optionally) learned parameter values.
        
        Arguments passed to the ``__init__`` method must be two or three arguments which
        are numpy arrays ``inputs`` and ``targets`` and optionally ``nugget``, described below,
        or a single argument which is the filename (string or file handle) of a previously saved emulator.
        
        ``inputs`` is a 2D array-like object holding the input data, whose shape is
        ``n`` by ``D``, where ``n`` is the number of training examples to be fit and ``D``
        is the number of input variables to each simulation. Because the model assumes all
        outputs are drawn from the same identical set of simulations (i.e. the normal use
        case is to fit a series of computer simulations with multiple outputs from the same
        input), the input to each emulator is identical.
        
        ``targets`` is the target data to be fit by the emulator, also held in an array-like
        object. This can be either a 1D or 2D array, where the last dimension must have length
        ``n``. If the ``targets`` array is of shape ``(n_emulators,n)``, then the emulator fits
        a total of ``n_emulators`` to the different target arrays, while if targets has shape
        ``(n,)``, a single emulator is fit.
        
        ``nugget`` is a list or other iterable of nugget parameters for each emulator. Its
        length must match the number of targets to be fit. The values must be ``None`` (adaptive
        noise addition) or a non-negative float, and the emulators can have different noise
        behaviors.
        
        If two  or three input arguments ``inputs``, ``targets``, and optionally ``nugget`` are
        given:
        
        :param inputs: Numpy array holding emulator input parameters. Must be 2D with shape
                       ``n`` by ``D``, where ``n`` is the number of training examples and

        :param targets: Numpy array holding emulator targets. Must be 2D or 1D with length
