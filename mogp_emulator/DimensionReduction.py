"""This module provides classes and utilities for performing dimension
reduction.  Currently there is a single class :class:`mogp_emulator.gKDR` which implements
the method of Fukumizu and Leng [FL13]_.

Example: ::

  >>> from mogp_emulator import gKDR
  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> X = np.array([[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]])
  >>> Y = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 5.0, 6.0])
  >>> xnew = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
  >>> dr = gKDR(X, Y, 1)
  >>> dr(xnew)
  array([0.60092477])

In this example, the reduction was performed from a two- to a
one-dimensional input space.  The value returned by ``dr(xnew)`` is
the input coordinate `xnew` transformed to the reduced space.

The following example illustrates how to perform Gaussian process
regression on the reduced input space:

::

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from mogp_emulator import gKDR, GaussianProcess

  ### generate some training data (from the function f)

  >>> def f(x):
  ...     return np.sqrt(x[0] + np.sin(0.1 * x[1]))

  >>> X = np.mgrid[0:10,0:10].T.reshape(-1,2)/10.0
  >>> print(X)
  [[0.  0. ]
   [0.1 0. ]
   [0.2 0. ]
   [0.3 0. ]
   [0.4 0. ]
   [0.5 0. ]
   [0.6 0. ]
   [0.7 0. ]
   [0.8 0. ]
   [0.9 0. ]
   [0.  0.1]
   [0.1 0.1]
   ...
   [0.8 0.9]
   [0.9 0.9]]

  >>> Y = np.apply_along_axis(f, 1, X)

  ### reduced input space
  >>> dr = gKDR(X,Y,1)

  ### train a Gaussian Process with reduced inputs
  >>> gp = GaussianProcess(dr(X), Y)
  >>> gp.learn_hyperparameters()

  ### make a prediction (given an input in the reduced space)
  >>> Xnew = np.array([0.12, 0.37])
  >>> gp.predict(dr(Xnew))
  (array([0.398083]), ...)

  >>> f(Xnew)
  0.396221

    Note that this is a simpler and faster method than the original
    "KDR" method by the same authors (but with an added
    approximation).  The KDR method will be implemented separately.

    An instance of this class is callable, with the ``__call__``
    method taking an input coordinate and mapping it to a reduced
    coordinate.

    Note that this class currently implements a *direct* translation
    of the Matlab implementation of KernelDeriv (see link above) into
    Python/NumPy.  It is due to be replaced with a Fortran
    implementation, but this should not affect the interface.
