Kernel Dimension Reduction (KDR) Demos
========================================================

This demo shows how to use the ``gKDR`` class to perform dimension reduction
on the inputs to an emulator. The examples show how dimension reduction
with a known number of dimensions can be fit, as well as how the class
can use cross validation to infer a best number of dimensions from the
data itself.
