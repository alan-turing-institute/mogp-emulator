Definition of Term: History Matching
====================================

History matching is a process that involves identifying the set of all
inputs :math:`\strut{x}` that would give rise to acceptable matches between
the simulator output :math:`\strut{f(x)}` and the observed data
:math:`\strut{z}`.

Often the process involves the iterative removal of regions of the input
space by the application of cutoffs to various :ref:`implausibility
measures<DefImplausibilityMeasure>`.
