The MUCM team is interested to receive your comments on the toolkit. You
can send comments about particular pages (to tell us of errors or
alternative approaches, or to give us the benefit of your own knowledge
and experience with MUCM-related ideas and methods). You can also send
us comments about the toolkit in general: (Do you like it? How could we
improve it generally? What features would you like to see? How could we
organise it better?).

Please send your comments to the
`webmaster <mailto:I.Andrianakis@soton.ac.uk>`__.
