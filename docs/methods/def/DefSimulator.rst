Definition of Term: Simulator
=============================

A simulator is a representation of some real-world system, usually
implemented as a computer program. Given appropriate inputs, the outputs
of the simulator are intended to represent specific properties of the
real system.

*Example*: A simulator of a nuclear power station reactor would take as
inputs a whole range of quantities describing the detailed design of the
reactor and the fuel. Its outputs might include values of heat energy
produced by the reactor (perhaps a sustained output level or a time
series).

The essence of the :ref:`MUCM<DefMUCM>` toolkit is to describe ways
to analyse simulator outputs using the techniques of first building an
:ref:`emulator<DefEmulator>`.
