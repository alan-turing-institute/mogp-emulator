Definition of Term: Second-order Exchangeability
================================================

A sequence of random variables is described as
:ref:`exchangeable<DefExchangeability>` when our beliefs (in terms of
a joint probability distribution) about that collection are unaffected
by the order in which they appear.

A less-restrictive specification is that of second-order
exchangeability. A sequence of random vectors is described as
second-order exchangeable if our beliefs in terms of the mean, variance
and covariance for that collection are unaffected by the permutation of
the order of the vectors. In other words, this requires that every
random vector has the same expectation and variance, and every pair of
vectors have the same covariance.

Second-order exchangeability is a concept that is expressed in terms of
expectations and variances rather than full probability distributions.
It is therefore often exploited in :ref:`Bayes
linear<DefBayesLinear>` analyses.
