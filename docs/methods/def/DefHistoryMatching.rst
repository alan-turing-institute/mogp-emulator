Definition of Term: History Matching
====================================

History matching is a process that involves identifying the set of all
inputs :math:`x` that would give rise to acceptable matches between
the simulator output :math:`f(x)` and the observed data
:math:`z`.

Often the process involves the iterative removal of regions of the input
space by the application of cutoffs to various :ref:`implausibility
measures<DefImplausibilityMeasure>`.
