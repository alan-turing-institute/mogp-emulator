.. _DefInactiveInput:

Definition of Term: Inactive input
==================================

An inactive input is a :ref:`simulator<DefSimulator>` input that is
not an :ref:`active input<DefActiveInput>`. Loosely, it is an input
that does not influence the output(s) of interest appreciably when it is
varied over the required range of input values. More precisely, the
values given to inactive inputs in the simulator runs for the :ref:`training
sample<DefTrainingSample>` are ignored when building the
:ref:`emulator<DefEmulator>`.
