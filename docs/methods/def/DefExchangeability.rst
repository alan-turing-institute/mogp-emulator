Definition of Term: Exchangeability
===================================

Exchangeability is regarded as a fundamental concept in any statistical
modelling -- regardless of whether that analysis is performed from a
:ref:`Bayesian<DefBayesian>` or frequentist perspective. A sequence
of random variables is described as exchangeable if our beliefs about
that collection are unaffected by the order in which they appear. For
example, if we perform 100 tosses of a coin, then, if the coin tosses
are exchangeable, our beliefs about the fairness of the coin will be
unaffected by the order in which we observe the heads and tails.

In formal terms, when our beliefs about a sequence of random variables
:math:`X_1, X_2, \ldots` are characterised by a joint probability
distribution, if the :math:`X_i`\s are exchangeable then the joint
probability distribution of the sequence is the same as the joint
distribution over any re-ordering of the :math:`X_i`\s. In fact, the
assertion of exchangeability implies the existence of this underlying
joint distribution.

This idea of exchangeability underpins the concept of prediction, as
when past observations and future observations are exchangeable then the
future will be predictable on the basis of the data gathered in the
past.
