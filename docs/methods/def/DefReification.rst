===============================

Perhaps the simplest technique for linking a model to reality is given
by the :ref:`Best Input<DefBestInput>` approach. Although very useful
and suitable for many applications, often a more detailed approach is
required.

A more careful treatment of the link between model and reality, is given
by a technique known as Reification. This involves linking the current
model :math:`f` to a Reified model :math:`f^+` which would
contain all known improvements to the current model. This is often done
via an intermediate model :math:`f'` that represents specific
improvements to the current model. The Reified model is subsequently
linked to reality.

Emulators are often used to describe each model in this process, as they
provide useful representations of the relevant uncertainties involved.
