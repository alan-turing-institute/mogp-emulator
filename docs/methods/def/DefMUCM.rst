========================

MUCM stands for 'Managing Uncertainty in Complex Models.' The MUCM
project is funded by a research grant from Research Councils UK, in
their Basic Technology programme. The objectives of the project are to
develop methods for analysing and managing the uncertainty in the
outputs produced by :ref:`simulators<DefSimulator>` of physical
systems, and as far as possible to show how these methods can be used
practically and simply in a wide variety of application areas.
