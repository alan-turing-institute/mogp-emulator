Definition of Term: Second-order belief specification
=====================================================

A belief specification for a collection of uncertain quantities is
described as *second order* when the beliefs are expressed solely in
terms of expectations and variances for every uncertain quantity, and
covariances between every pair of quantities. This differs from a fully
probabilistic specification which requires a joint probability
distribution over all unknown quantities. The second-order specification
is the basis for :ref:`Bayes Linear<DefBayesLinear>` methods.
