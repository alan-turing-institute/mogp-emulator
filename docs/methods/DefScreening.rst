Definition of Term: Screening
=============================

Screening is the process of identifying the :ref:`active
inputs<DefActiveInput>` that drive a simulator's behaviour, so
that only these inputs need to be considered when building and using the
emulator. It is common to find that only a small number of inputs to the
simulator are relevant to the prediction of the output of interest.
