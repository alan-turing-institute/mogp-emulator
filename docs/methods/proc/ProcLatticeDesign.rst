Procedure: Generate a lattice design
====================================

Description and Background
--------------------------

A lattice design is one of a number of non-random space-filling designs
suitable for defining a set of points in the
:ref:`simulator<DefSimulator>` input space for creating a :ref:`training
sample<DefTrainingSample>`.

The :math:`n` point lattice in :math:`p` dimensions is generated by a positive
integer generator set :math:`g=(g_1,\ldots,g_p)`. See the "Additional
Comments" below for discussion of the choice of generators.

Inputs
------

-  Number of dimensions :math:`p`
-  Number of runs desired :math:`n`
-  Set of positive integer generators :math:`g_1,\ldots,g_p`

Outputs
-------

-  Lattice design :math:`D = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}`

Procedure
---------

For :math:`j=0,\ldots,n-1`, generate lattice points as

.. math::
   x_{j+1}=\left(\frac{j}{n}g_1{\rm mod} 1,\ldots,\frac{j}{n}g_d{\rm
   mod} 1\right).

Note that the operator "mod 1" here has the effect of returning the
fractional part of each number. For instance, if :math:`j=7, n=50` and
:math:`g_1 = 13`, then

.. math::
   \frac{j}{n}g_1 = 1.82

and so

.. math::
   \frac{j}{n}g_1 {\rm mod} 1=0.82.

Additional Comments
-------------------

A potential problem with lattice designs is the difficulty in finding
suitable generators for a lattice. A condition for generators is that
:math:`g_1,\ldots,g_d` and :math:`n` should form a set of relatively prime
numbers. However, this seems to be a necessary but not sufficient
condition to obtain a lattice that fills the design space well.
